# Introduction
The Project entitled ‘Real Estate Price Prediction’ attempts to use Machine Learning Algorithms to predicting values of a given property. The performance will be measured upon predicting house prices since the prediction in many regression algorithms relies not only on a specific feature but on an unknown number of attributes that result in the value to be predicted. 

# Algorithm Used
* Linear Regression
* K-Fold Cross Validation and GridSearchCV (for optimal model selection)

# Tech-Stack
* Python 3.10.6
* Flask 2.2.3
* NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotlib for Data Visualization 
* Sckit-Learn for Model Training and Evaluation
